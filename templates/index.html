                Traffic Management refers to the combination of measures that serve to preserve traffic capacity and improve the 
                security, safety and reliability of the overall road transport system. These measures make use of ITS systems, 
                services and projects in day-to-day operations that impact on road network performance. Proper traffic management 
                can ensure that:

                <li>Traffic flows smoothly and efficiently.</li>
                <li>Roads are well maintained and safe for all users, including pedestrians and cyclists.</li>
                <li>Congestion, local pollution and accidents are minimized.</li>
                <li>Vehicles are within speed limits and heading in the correct direction along the lane.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p>- Reducing vehicle speed can prevent road crash incidents as an average 1 km increase in vehicle speed can lead to a 3 percent increase in road accidents.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">- Detecting and Categorizing different types of vehicle in traffic flow can help in determining vehicle speed using optical flow and enforcing speed limits.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">- Single Shot Detector architecture with MobileNet_v3 backbone is utilized for categorizing different Vehicle types.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">- Traffic Density Classification will be instrumental in redirecting traffic from major roads during peak hours and making the overall movement safer and more efficient.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">- EfficientNet_b0 architecture is utilized for traffic density classification into Empty, Low, Medium, High, and Traffic Jam categories.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">- It will be critical for ensuring the safety of drivers and the overall efficiency of transportation infrastructure.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">- Single Shot Detector with MobileNet_v3 backbone is utilized for detecting potholes on the roads.</p>
